Summary(Optional) :   The dataset contains information related to various attributes and features of credit card applications, along with a binary label indicating the approval status (approved or not approved). The classification analysis aims to explore the relationship between the independent variables (such as income, age, credit history, employment status, etc.) and the dependent variable (credit card approval) to build a predictive model.
